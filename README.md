## Features

The app consists of 2 modules, the vitual footware try-on module and the foot size measurement module.

### Virtual Footware Try-on

This module provides the user with an AR experience to try-on the shoe. The AR module is linked to snapchat making user of the AR shoe filters that Snapchat provides. 

### Foot Size Measurement 

This module provides the user with the ability to measure his/her foot through the app. The user is asked to place the foot on an A4 size paper with the bottom of the foot aligned with the bottom of the sheet and take a picture of the foot along with the paper. A Flask server is hosted online which is where the image captured is sent. The server processes the image and calculates the size which is sent to the app and is displayed to the user.
